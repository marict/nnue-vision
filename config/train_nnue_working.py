"""NNUE Working Configuration - Matches Successful Local Comparison

This config reproduces the exact settings used in the local benchmark where
NNUE achieved 31.2% vs EtinyNet's 15.6% accuracy on CIFAR-10.

Key fixes:
- Light augmentation (not heavy)
- Explicit target_size to ensure 32x32
- Reduced learning rate for stability
- Settings that actually converge
